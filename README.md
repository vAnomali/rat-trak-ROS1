# Rat Trak: Automatic Gait Tracking System

## Project Overview
**Rat Trak** is an innovative camera tracking system designed to improve gait analysis in rodent-based research. Rodents are widely used in developing treatments for various diseases and injuries, and gait analysis is a crucial tool for assessing the efficacy of these treatments. However, traditional systems for gait analysis are expensive and time-consuming. **Rat Trak** solves this problem by providing a cost-effective, automated system capable of continuously recording a rat's gait and stride with high precision.

This system enhances the yield of research data while reducing overhead costs and operational complexity. It will initially support research in the Spence Lab for spinal cord injury studies, with potential applications in other research areas.

## Features
- **High-Speed Camera Tracking**: Captures detailed gait and stride data with precision.
- **Timing Belt Gantry System**: Ensures stable and smooth movement of the high-speed camera.
- **Secondary Tracking Camera**: Keeps the high-speed camera centered on the rat at all times.
- **Automation**: Minimizes manual intervention and maximizes research data output.

## System Architecture
1. **High-Speed Camera**: Mounted to a timing belt gantry for capturing detailed stride analysis.
2. **Timing Belt Gantry**: Provides precise camera motion control.
3. **Secondary Tracking Camera**: Monitors the rat's position to ensure the high-speed camera stays aligned.
4. **Software**: Custom-designed codebase to control the cameras and synchronize their operation with the gantry system.
